# librepods (patched fork)

A fork of [librepods](https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods) by **Kavish
Devar**, who reverse-engineered Apple's AAP protocol over L2CAP and the BLE
advertisement path that carries battery, in-ear and case-lid state. That is the
hard part, and it is his.

This repository carries the Linux daemon plus the patches the
[AirPods Noctalia plugin](https://github.com/harveywuk/airpods) needs. Upstream
does not have them, so nothing packaged will do.

## What the patches add

- A **published state file** — one line of JSON at
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/librepods/status.json`, written on change and removed on quit.
- A **`status` verb** and the **`ca:`**, **`onebud:`**, **`adaptive:N`** and
  **`ear:`** control verbs (upstream has only the noise verbs).
- **AirPods Pro 3 support** and a current model map, including a
  `supports_noise_off` flag (the Pro 3 has no Off mode).
- **Case-lid state** from BLE advertisements.
- The **control socket moved off `/tmp`** to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/librepods.sock`
  (mode 0700).
- A **systemd user unit** bound to `graphical-session.target`, and a
  **`--headless` mode** that builds no tray or QML engine.
- Notifications through the host desktop rather than a Qt tray toast.

See [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for the exact fork point and the full change log.
